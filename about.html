                I’m a passionate Frontend Developer who specializes in building both dynamic and simple websites with clean, user-friendly designs. Alongside web development, I’m also a creative Video Editor, working on wedding films, ads, cinematic projects, and event highlights. Currently, I’m pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA), which helps me strengthen my technical foundation while exploring innovative ways to merge technology with creativity.
